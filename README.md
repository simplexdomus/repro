# Evolution

**Cellular Transformation**

---

An interactive visualization exploring the fundamental process of cell division and the 4.5 billion year journey of life on Earth.

## Overview

This project presents a minimalist, abstract visualization of mitosis—the process by which a single cell divides into two identical daughter cells. The animation cycles through all five phases of cell division:

- **Interphase** — Cell growth and DNA replication
- **Prophase** — Chromatin condenses, nuclear membrane dissolves
- **Metaphase** — Chromosomes align at the equatorial plane
- **Anaphase** — Sister chromatids separate to opposite poles
- **Telophase** — New nuclear membranes form, cytokinesis completes

## Features

- Full-screen animated mitosis visualization
- Evolutionary timeline spanning 4.5 billion years
- Interactive phase selection for detailed exploration
- Generative ambient audio (browser-synthesized)
- Responsive, monochromatic design
- No external dependencies

## Live Demo

## Technology

Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Audio is generated in real-time using the Web Audio API. No frameworks, no libraries, no build process required.

## Local Development

```
git clone https://github.com/simplexdomus/repro.git
cd repro
